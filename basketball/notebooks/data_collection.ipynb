        "\n",
        "One of the goals for the data collection component of this project is to produce a `robust`, *organized* dataset that can grow to as **large of a scale** as possible. You can find an explanation of my solution for storing the files related to the [***Basketball Dataset***](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) below.\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "***Kaggle*** offers many formats of which one can save files to a dataset, which include: `CSV`, `JSON`, `SQLite`, and `Archives`, among others. The platform essentially acts similarly to industrial cloud solutions like *Google Cloud Platform's* (**GCP**) ***Cloud Storage*** or *Amazon Web Service's* (**AWS**) ***S3*** albeit with a **100GB** storage capacity. ***Kaggle*** datasets as well as these industrial solutions can be considered as broad object/file storage and in certain data engineering paradigms can serve as data lakes. \n",
        "\n",
        "It seems that many state-of-the-art (SOTA) data storage solutions pivot around an organizational-wide data lake (of which itself allows for general object storage) that has multiple inputs (*\"tributaries\"*) both streaming into and routinely added to the overall lake. One benefit of this paradigm is that the lake facilitates the storage of both structured (tabular) and unstructured (image, video, audio, text, etc) data. This can prove useful because, as time progresses, new techniques for extracting useful information from unstructured data can be utilized. Thus it also seems like a good idea to hold onto all extracted data, if possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "***Kaggle*** datasets can serve as data lakes through the archival process or simply by storing data files in their raw file format. This certainly serves as a strong foundation for building a &#8212; one day in the future &#8212; <b><i>\"big data\"</i></b> collection. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is further work that can be done in configuring ***Kaggle*** datasets to enable additional platform functionality as well as improved storage efficiency. Structured data, whether structured upon extraction or structured through some pre-processing, can be stored in a ***SQLite*** database (`.sqlite` file type) as opposed to storing individual files such as `CSVs` or `JSONs` within the dataset. Thus, a single database file is stored as an object within the dataset, enabling additional functionality. One easily discerned advantage with storing in ***SQLite*** is that histograms of the distribution of across continuous variables are given directly within ***Kaggle***. \n",
        "\n",
        "As this project moves forward, I hope to collect a large collection of both structured and unstructured data. I hope that the ***SQLite*** database (`basketball.sqlite`) can serve to house the structured data in an efficient, useful format, similarly to the [***European Soccer Database***](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)."
